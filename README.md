# server-client  
Implement two programs in C:  

* Server program:

     - Initialize a hash table of given size (command line)  

     - Support insertion of items in the hash table  

     - Hash table collisions are resolved by maintaining a linked list 
for each bucket/entry in the hash table  

     - Supports concurrent operations (multithreading) to perform 
(insert, read, delete operations on the hash table)  

     - Use readers-writer lock to ensure safety of concurrent 
operations, try to optimize the granularity  

     - Communicates with the client program using shared memory buffer 
(POSIX shm)      

* Client program:

     - Enqueue requests/operations (insert, read a bucket, delete) to 
the server (that will operate on the the hash table) via shared memory 
buffer (POSIX shm)
